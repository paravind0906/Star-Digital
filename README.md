# Star-Digital

Star Digital is a multichannel video service provider and goal of this project is to analyze consumer response to ad decisions on the Star Digital Platform and answer the following questions.

1. Is online advertising effective for Star Digital? In other words, is there a difference in conversion rate between the treatment and control groups?

2. Is there a frequency effect of advertising on purchase? In particular, the question is whether increasing the frequency of advertising (number of impressions) increases the probability of purchase? 

3. How does the conversion effectiveness of Sites 1-5 compare with that of Site 6?

4. Which sites should Star Digital advertise on? In particular, should it put its advertising dollars in Site 6 or in Sites 1 through 5?
